# My Workflow
1. Include paper with pdf in Zotero
2. Read it using Zotero: highlight and take notes (comments flag only)
3. Add "note from annotation"  at Zotero
4. In obsidian call Zotero Integration - import notes #1 (or the name you gave it)
5. Add paper
6. Write the prompts in the Summary (change it as you like)
7. Select your take aways as ideas - if you feel like it. 
8. Use template "My writing" to start a new paper draft/ chapter dissertation and include all the lit review

Optional
	Use Daily notes as a Research Diary and task management system
		1. use hashtag research-diary to write a paragraph about what was done in the daily note
		2. use - [ ] to tasks or questions to answer later.

PS.: If images were not automatically included, drag them from Images folder to your note file
